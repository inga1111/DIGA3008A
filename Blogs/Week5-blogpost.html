    <h1>WEEK FIVE-BLOG POST</h1>
</body>
<h2>GOAL ALIGNMENT:</h2>
<body>
    <p>My goal is to ultimately produce a website in which I can showcase my creativity and my projects as a multidimensional artist in a way that is aesthetically pleasing and serves as an extension of my personality. I would like for each discipline that I have done projects for, to be accessible on my website. And mostly I would like my portfolio to showcase my process as an artist and developer. Not just the end result. Which is why I want to be very particular about my design page and ensure that it shows my thought process and creative process by including wireframes, style guides and inspiration. My other goal is to utilise this website as a sort of diary that records the process of creating a website and what it takes to create a website as a beginner at HTML. This would serve as a guide not just for me but also for anyone who would like to see the process of website creation for beginners.</p> 

    <p>I want users to be able to interact with my website in an immersive and visually stimulating way. In a way that is fun to look at. I would like for them to be able to see my capabilities as an artist and to access my projects.</p>

    <p>As for my target audience, I imagine my users to be people who are seeking someone with the creative skills that I display throughout my website whether to look for inspiration from, collaboration with or to request commission work from.</p>

    <p>As for what is important, I would say the portfolio page and contact pages are the most important as that is the whole point of the website and it is important that people who would like to contact me are able to do so. The same goes for what is the most interesting in the website, I would say the portfolio and design sections are.</p>
