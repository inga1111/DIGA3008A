    <h2>USER ALIGNMENT</h2>
    <body>
        <p>For my website I would say my target audience are those who are interested in the consumption of creative work and so because of this I want to ensure that my website is very visually stimulating and appeals to those who appreciate visual arts and aesthetics. I want my website to also be memorable and so captivating that users are encouraged to explore the entire website with pure interest. Itâ€™s also important to note that if I want users, especially potential collaborators and employers, to explore my whole website I would have to make sure that it is user-friendly so basically; immersive, readable at all times and easy to navigate smoothly and swiftly. Which is why I want to make sure that my pages are structured in a way that is organised, guarantees readability and most importantly consistency. Consistency would make it easier for users to quickly get a hang of how to navigate my website swiftly, encouraging them to engage with it fully. I want to make use of a Navigation bar that is precise and clear as to what each page on the website entails.</p>

    <h2>USER EXPERIENCE</h2>

    <p>After users interact with my website, I want them to be left with feelings of satisfaction and peaked interest. I want the experience to create a visual experience that is both pleasing, unique and vibrant. I aim for my website to speak to those who resonate design and art the way I do and to feel as though this website is a good example of a website that successfully creates and informative space that is readable, user-friendly while still being aesthetically pleasing and just fun to engage with. </p>

    <h2>USER INTERFACE</h2>
    <p>In terms of interface I want to use buttons that are clear and also easy to click on, because I have had experiences where in some websites it was difficult to navigate and explore the website because the buttons were too small or unclear etc. I also want to incorporate a nav bar that serves as a useful information tool in the sense that the user will know exactly which part of the website they are on based on the nav bar. I want to make use of either zoom in or shadow effects when users interact with buttons or certain text/images. 

    </p>

    <h2>SITE CONTENT</h2>
    <p>Each one of my pages will have a seperate page and the main pages will be accesible via the nav bar</p>
