    <p>
        For me an ethical internet is an internet that allows agency and ensures inclusivity for all demographic across the world. An ethical internet is one that places human dignity, equity, and collective well-being at its core. It treats privacy as a fundamental right rather than a feature to be toggled or sold, ensuring that data collection is minimised, consent is meaningful and surveillance—whether corporate or governmental—is transparent and accountable. Everyone should have equitable access to the internet, regardless of geography or income, with digital literacy regarded as an essential component of education to empower people to navigate online spaces safely and critically.

Freedom of expression is protected on an ethical internet, but not at the expense of others’ safety. Platforms are responsible for curbing harassment, hate speech, and misinformation, with algorithms that prioritise truth and respectful dialogue over engagement and outrage. Technology should amplify diverse voices, not replicate systemic biases. Transparency and accountability are also central: algorithms and AI systems must be explainable and auditable, and tech companies should answer to the public interest, not just shareholders. Manipulative design patterns that trick users or exploit psychological vulnerabilities are removed from ethical design practices.

Finally, an ethical internet is environmentally responsible. The digital world is not immaterial—its infrastructure consumes massive amounts of energy. An ethical approach includes transparency about environmental impact and a commitment to reducing harm through sustainable practices. Ultimately, an ethical internet is a public good: inclusive, participatory, and designed to empower rather than exploit.
