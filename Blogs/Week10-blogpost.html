    <p>The article "Internet Access is a Fundamental Right" by S. Kasapis (2020) presents a great argument for recognizing internet access as a fundamental human right, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Kasapis highlights the importance of internet access for various aspects of life, including education, healthcare, and economic opportunities. By drawing on existing literature , such as the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the concept of digital divide, the author shows that internet access is essential for individuals to fully participate in modern society.

 

        One of the key strengths of Kasapis' argument is its emphasis on the interconnectedness of internet access and other fundamental rights. The author notes that internet access is necessary for accessing information, education, and healthcare, which are all essential for individuals to exercise their rights and participate in society. This argument is supported by research from the World Bank, which has shown that internet access can have a significant impact on economic growth and poverty reduction (World Bank, 2019). By recognizing internet access as a fundamental right, governments and policymakers can take steps to ensure that all individuals have access to the opportunities and resources they need to thrive.
        
         
        
        While Kasapis' argument is well-supported, it would benefit from a more nuanced discussion of the digital divide and its complexities. For instance, research by Jan van Dijk (2020) emphasizes the importance of considering factors like digital literacy and access to devices, in addition to internet connectivity. Digital literacy is a critical component of internet access, as individuals need to have the skills and knowledge necessary to effectively use the internet and access the opportunities and resources it provides. Also, evidence-based research would strengthen Kasapis' argument by providing valuable insights into the experiences of different demographics. For example, studies by the Pew Research Center (2020) have shown that there are significant inequaities in internet access and digital literacy among different racial and socioeconomic groups in the United States. By examining the experiences of different demographics, researchers and policymakers can develop targeted solutions to address the digital divide and ensure that all individuals have access to the opportunities and resources they need to thrive.
        
         
        
        The article's conclusion that governments and policymakers have a responsibility to ensure internet access is available and affordable for all is well-supported. However, it would be beneficial to explore the complexities of implementing internet access as a fundamental right. Research by authors like Tim Wu (2018) highlights the importance of considering issues like net neutrality and the role of internet service providers. Net neutrality is a critical component of internet access, as it ensures that all individuals have equal access to online content and services.
        
        Additional research supports Kasapis' argument, including studies by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (2020). These studies demonstrate the impact of internet access on digital skills and economic growth, and highlight the importance of developing policies and programs to support digital inclusion. 
        
        Future research could build on Kasapis' work by conducting research-based studies, gor example, researchers could conduct case studies of cities or countries that have implemented policies to promote internet access and digital inclusion, and examine the impact of these policies on different demographics. By examining the experiences of different stakeholders and exploring the potential challenges and complexities of implementing internet access as a fundamental right, researchers and policymakers can develop effective solutions to address the digital divide and that way they can create global equality when it comes to internet access.
        
         
        
        In conclusion, Kasapis' article provides a strong foundation for understanding the importance of internet access as a fundamental right. By considering the complexities and challenges of implementing this right, researchers and policymakers can work towards ensuring that internet access is available and affordable for all, ultimately promoting greater social, economic, and political participation. As the world becomes increasingly digital, it is essential that all individuals have access to the opportunities and resources they need to thrive in the digital economy. When i governments and policymakers can undertsand and agree that internet access is a fundamental right, they will be ablev to take steps to ensure that all individuals have the same opportunities they need to succeed.
