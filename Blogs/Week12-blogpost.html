        In order for me to discuss decolonialism I would need to understand it and define it. Decolonialism refers to the process of undoing colonialism, both in terms of political independence and, more deeply, in challenging and dismantling the lingering systems, mindsets, and structures imposed by colonial powers. Decolonialising is more about rethinking how, why, and for whom you code, and challenging the Eurocentric, corporate-dominated paradigms that have historically shaped the web. i would work towards decolonialising my code by making sure I am not just mimicking global Western design standards, and that I make sure my website is inclusive to those with disabilities and relatable to South African users especially, or better yet universally relatable. Another great way is by making sure my website can be used or accessed without internet connection because not everyone has that access.  

        For this discussion, I will be discussing the changes that I will be making to my website in terms of how I will be incorporating Javascript . I want to use Javascript to add gallery sections wherever my website allows for people to view multiple images. This will not only improve the visual representation of my website but also make it so much more efficient and easier to navigate for users. I would like to also use Javascript to animate things across my website such as buttons and images for a more interesting experience on the website.
