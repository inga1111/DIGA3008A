    <h1>Eleventh blog entry</h1>

    <p>
        As I read Sheena Magenya's article "Making a Feminist Internet in Africa," I was struck by the importance of centering African feminist perspectives in shaping the digital world. I think it's crucial to consider how different factors like race, class, and geography intersect to affect African women's experiences online. By doing so, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complex challenges we face and work towards creating a more inclusive digital landscape.

Magenya's article made me think about how power structures exclude marginalized communities from digital conversations, and how we can work to dismantle these structures. I believe that centering African feminist voices can help challenge dominant narratives and promote inclusivity online. This is especially important in the digital age, where online spaces can be both empowering and marginalizing.

The article also highlighted the significant barriers African women face in accessing the digital sphere. I was struck by how lack of infrastructure, affordability, and social norms all contribute to this exclusion. For me, this emphasizes the need for targeted strategies to address these issues and create a more inclusive digital world. This might involve investing in digital infrastructure, promoting digital literacy, and advocating for policies that support equal access to the internet.

One of the points that stood out to me the most was the fact that a lot of the internet today has been largely westernised. This is so true and I have had this conversation many times before. The fact that we are so heavily influenced by the West is problematic but can also be beneficial. Problematic because it is kind of a loss of identity for us across the rest of the world, we end up idolising Western culture and politics so much that we abandon our own and it creates the idea that our own media is inferior. Another problem with so much of the media being westernised is the fact that they do not really receive our media or care about it or can engage with it, which again pushes the idea that our media is inferior or unimportant. We also allow ourselves to be easily influenced and victims of propaganda when we rely so much on the West. However , as I mentioned, it can be beneficial as we can learn a lot from the West because they are a very advanced and developed part of the world.

Overall, Magenya's article made a strong case for prioritizing African feminist perspectives in shaping the digital landscape. I think this is essential for creating a digital world that truly reflects the diversity and complexity of African women's experiences. By prioritizing these perspectives, I believe we can build a more inclusive and representative digital sphere that empowers marginalized communities and promotes social justice.
