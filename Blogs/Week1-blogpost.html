        <h2>EXPERIENCE WITH GETTING STARTED</h2>
        
        <p>My experience with setting up Github was alright and manageable. My understanding was better the better the tutorials and guidance I received was.
        As I reflect on Susan Harper’s reflection of  Vannevar Bush’s “As we may think” on its 65th anniversary , it is interesting to see the ways in which
        Bush’s vision for how information would be managed and retrieved has influenced the way in which the internet has developed including our digital experiences. 
        Bush’s vision of the “Memex” system where we can store, organise and link information laid the groundwork for the modern web. His idea of associative trails 
        become fundamental aspect of the web. We use hyperlinks to navigate and connect related information which mirrored Bush’s vision.
        Bush would also have concerns about information overload as well as how efficiently we could retrieve information from systems. Today we have search engines like
        Google that have become essential for navigating vast amounts of information. 
        In his ideas Bush also highlighted the importance of sharing information and collaboration. Today we have social platforms and online forums which facilitate this.
        The “memex” was designed to augment or enhance human memory and learning. The internet has indeed changed how we process information.
        Although we have access to all of this information at such large quantities, there are still concerns about our experience on the internet today. The ease of
        publishing online has raised concerns regarding the spread of misinformation being spread. We also experience challenges with global connectivity as not all
        communities can access the internet the same way. Another concern about the web is user privacy and control of personal data.</p>

        <p>In conclusion, Vannevar Bush’s “As We May Think” laid the groundwork for many of the internet’s core features and functionalities. However, the internet’s
           evolution has also introduced new challenges and complexities that require ongoing critical reflection. The thing that i found to be interesting about the
            history of the web are that the internet and the web are often used interchangeably, but they're not the same thing. The internet refers to the underlying
            network infrastructure, while the web refers to the system of interlinked hypertext documents.
