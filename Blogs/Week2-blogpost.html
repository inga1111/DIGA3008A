        <h2>Reflection on Moulthrop, S (2003):
            </h2>
            <h3>HOW DOES IT SPEAK TO MEDIA TODAY?</h3>
            <body>
                <p>Stuart Moulthrop's article "You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media" (2003) reflects on the evolution of hypertext and its implications for the internet. While it does highlight the internet's potential for non-linear narrative and interactive storytelling Moulthrop also notes its disadvantages and limitations. These include the integration of content, loss of depth and basically the limitations of hypertext. also, the article touches on the internet's limitations, such as access and equity issues, censorship, user privacy and control. 
                    </p>

                    <p>Moulthrop's 2003 article also explores the evolution of hypertext and its impact on the internet. He discusses how hypertext was initially seen as revolutionary. The article is still relevant today, as social media platforms have amplified non-linear narrative, interactive media has blurred the lines between reader and writer, and hypertext continues to evolve with advances in technology. Moulthrop's insights encourage us to consider how technology shapes our experiences and challenges traditional notions of media and communication. Moulthrop's article provides a subtle view of the internet, emphasizing both its potential and limitations, and encouraging a critical examination of its impact on society and culture.</p>
