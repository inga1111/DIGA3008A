        <h1>WEEK SEVEN-BLOG POST</h1>

        <h2>REVIEWING AN EXISTING WEBSITE:</h2>

<p>The website I will be reviewing for this week's blog post is Temu. Temu is an international online retail service that allows you to purchase almost anything. here are some of the Pros and Cons I have identified about the website:</p>

<h3> PROS </h3>

<p>-The TEMU website is great at refining your search and curating searches into catefories that relate to each other, so when you search for one specific item you will be presented with more items like the one you searched and items related to your search.</p>

<p>-The website is inclusive in the sense that one can change the language into one they understand or prefer, there i also the option to select your country's currency which allows for a more accurate and straightforward shopping.</p>

<p>-The colour scheme remains consistent throughout the website.</p>

<h3>CONS</h3>

<p>-The website can get overwhelming very easily as there is just way too much going on and being displayed all at once.</p>

<p>-The website is not the most user friendly for beginners and it is not obvious where to go or how to navigate the website smoothly.</p>

<p>-There are far too many redirects when you select a new page on the nav bar for some reason each selection just creates a whole new tab, </p>
<p>something as simple as selecting an item to purchase redirects you and creates a whole new tab in your search . </p>
<p>This is a major flaw and ends up clogging your browser with many unnecessary tabs and this results in storage loss and cache build up.

<p>-Lastly, the website could look a lot better in terms of layout, site mapping and just the overall structure and appearance.</p>

<p>-There are far too many pop up ads and pop up spinning wheel reward systems that pop up and completely redirect you once you participate.</p>
        </p>
