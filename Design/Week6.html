        <h1>WEEK SIX BLOG-POST</h1>
        <h2>Design section</h2>
        <h3>Goal aesthetic</h3>

        <p>
            My goal aesthetic as a single statement is bold vintage glamour or 2000s bold glamour with touches of leopard print. In vintage fashion especially, 
            animal print was seen as a status symbol and considered luxurious, I am against the use of real animal skin for ethical reasons but I am intriuged
             by the visual appeal of animal skins, and I believe we can make beautiful things using the patterns found on these animals so long as it is faux.</p>
            <p>I want to go for something reminiscent of the 70s-90s and early 2000s glamour diva / beauty queen style with a lot of animal print accents and
            very feminine textures. All of this but with a touch of modern style and minimalism. Also with a touch of jungle feel with the exotic flowers and wild animals.</p>

          <h3>Color Swatches</h3>

          <p>my colour palette consists mostly of pinks , creams, black and animal print.

            <h3>Font Samples</h3>

          <p>I want to make use of a bold and elegant font that is still clean ,readable and minimalistic. encapsulates the drama and beauty of a glamorous woman.</p>
