    <h3>colour palettes and layouts</h3>

    <p>I wanted to go for designs that were colourful and feminine so I chose a colour palette that was pastel and had soft tones but with bold images and visuals.</p>
    <p>The colour palette I ended up settling for includes the folllowing colour codes</p>
