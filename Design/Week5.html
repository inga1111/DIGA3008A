        <h1>WEEK FIVE-BLOG POST</h1>

        <p>My goal is to ultimately produce a website in which I can showcase my creativity</p>
        <p>and my projects as a multidimensional artist in a way that is aesthetically pleasing </p>
         <p>and serves as an extension of my personality. I would like for each discipline that </p>
         <p>I have done projects for, to be accessible on my website.</p>
        <p>And mostly I would like my portfolio to showcase my process as an artist and developer.</p>
        <p>Not just the end result. Which is why I want to be very particular about my design page and</p>
        <p>ensure that it shows my thought process and creative process by including wireframes,</p.>
        <p>style guides and inspiration.</p>
        <p>other goal is to utilise this website as a sort of diary that records the process of </p>
        <p>creating a website and what it takes to create a website as a beginner at HTML.</p>
        <p>This would serve as a guide not just for me but also for anyone who would like to see</p>
        <p>the process of website creation for beginners. </p>

        <h2>How I want users to interact with my website</h2>
        <p>I want users to be able to interact with my website in an immersive </p>
        <p>and visually stimulating way. In a way that is fun to look at.</p>
        <p> I would like for them to be able to see my capabilities as an artist and to access my projects.</p> 
        <p>As for my target audience, I imagine my users to be people who are seeking someone </p>
        <p>with the creative skills that I display throughout my website whether to look for</p>
        <p> inspiration from, collaboration with or to request commission work from.</p> 
        <p>As for what is important, I would say the portfolio page and contact pages are </p>
        <p>the most important as that is the whole point of the website and</p>
        <p> it is important that people who would like to contact me are able to do so. </p>
        <p>The same goes for what is the most interesting</p>
