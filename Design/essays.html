        <p>UI & UX: An Analysis on the South African website for: Two Oceans Aquarium 
By: Inga Mlonzi

“Interaction on the web is structured through the UI and UX”. For this analysis I will be breaking down the UI and UX present in the South African aquarium, “Two Oceans Aquarium” website. I will use prescribed lecture slides, readings and independent research to support my crtitical observation. To begin ,I will provide the simple definition of UI and UX. UI stands for User Interface, referring to the visual layout and interactive elements of a product or application, such as buttons, icons, and screens and then UX stands for User Experience, encompassing the overall feeling and satisfaction a user has when interacting with a product or service. 
The Two Oceans Aquarium website is an online platform that showcases the marine life and conservation efforts of the aquarium, located in Cape Town. The website's primary target audience I would say is tourists and residents who are interested in the ocean, its’ creatures as well as actually visiting the aquarium to see these creatures up close. The website's purpose is to provide information about the aquarium's exhibits, events, and conservation efforts, as well as to allow visitors to purchase tickets online, book a diving experience and membership purchases.
Analysing the UI/UX and ethics of the Two Oceans Aquarium website, or any website for that matter, is important because it can help with understanding UI and UX practically and seeing how it affects how much knowledge we have when it comes to being web developers. As Ghanchi, J. (2021) emphasises in) ‘Ethical Design: Why Is It Critical for UX Designers?’, ethical design is critical for UX designers, and this analysis will explore how the Two Oceans Aquarium website embodies these principles. To strengthen my analysis, I will also very briefly identify areas for improvement in terms of user experience, accessibility, and responsible design but also acknowledge the website’s strengths. 
As a popular tourist destination, the website has a significant impact on the aquarium's reputation and the number of people who could ultimately know about it and potentially visit, especially in an age where the internet is so useful in finding things to do in a new destination.
To reiterate, the goal of this analysis is to evaluate the usability, accessibility, and ethical design of the Two Oceans Aquarium website, identifying strengths and weaknesses.
To start off, the website's visual design is captivating, with high-quality images and videos of marine life. You are immediately immersed within a digital representation of what your experience could be and viewers are not confused about the service being provided. The colour scheme is predominantly blue, which reflects the ocean's theme and the typography is a bold and simplistic font, making it clear and readable. According to Mok, J (2023), defining ethical UX involves considering the intersection of morality and design, which is evident in the Two Oceans Aquarium website's design choices The website's layout is clean in terms of structure and easy to navigate but it might also be a little bit content dense which can make it slightly overwhelming to decide where to explore, especially because some of the content is repeated across the pages of the website and in the navigation bar. The website's branding is consistent with the aquarium's identity, and the use of imagery and video effectively showcases the aquarium's exhibits and conservation efforts.
The website's layout is structured well, with clear headings and navigation menus. There is use of call-to-action buttons. Call-to-action (CTA) button is an interactive UI element both web and mobile. Its’ major aim is to induce people to take certain actions such as purchase something. The CTA buttons for this website are a bold yellow compared to the blues and whites and so they are prominent and easy to find, making it simple for users to plan a visit or learn about the aquarium's activities. As S, AK (2024) notes in ‘Ethical UX Design Best Practices: A Comprehensive Guide’, ethical UX design best practices include providing clear and transparent CTAs, which the Two Oceans Aquarium website does effectively. The website's consistency in design elements, such as typography and colour scheme, contributes to a cohesive and readable user experience throughout.
In terms of responsiveness, the website is very responsive and it gives you the same quality regardless of what device you are using. The version on a cell phone compared to the laptop is different in terms of structure but the content is the same, simply adapting to different screen sizes.
To analyse the user experience, I will begin with the navigation. The website's navigation is intuitive, allowing users to find information about exhibits, events, and conservation efforts .There is a navigation bar that makes it great to explore the website efficiently, and to make things even better, it is a sticky navigation The website's structure is also logical, which makes it easy for users to plan a visit or learn about the aquarium's activities without interacting with unnecessary elements and content.
The website's user flow is well-designed, making it easy for users to book tickets or purchase memberships online. The users can easily navigate the website using the nav-bar, the flow is consistent and straight-forward. The website provides feedback to users, such as confirmation messages and ticket details, which helps to reduce anxiety and uncertainty about whether or not your ticket purchase was successful or not. For performance, the website loads quickly and efficiently, with minimal lags or technical frustrations. However, like any website, this is not necessarily an indication of bad web-design, it could be a network issue.
Reflecting back on the website's content, though it is engaging and informative, providing users with a wealth of information about the aquarium's exhibits, events, and conservation efforts, as I mentioned before, there is a lot of information to consume and I think there could be a way to structure it better to avoid the density and repetitive information, for example if it is in the nav-bar, there does not need to be a link to a specific page on every page, it is alreqady in the nav-bar. The tone is friendly and approachable, making the website accessible to a wide range of users and it is inviting, you end up wanting to visit the aquarium.
For the ethical design considerations, I will begin by discussing the accessibility. The website has made efforts to support accessibility, including screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation. However, there may be areas for improvement, such as ensuring proper contrast and alt text for images for when they do not load, so that users are still aware of what content is in the website. The website has a clear and accessible privacy policy, outlining how user data is collected, stored, and protected. Users are informed about cookies and tracking, and they are given choices about how their data is used. There is complete transparency throughout the website, with no hidden advertisements, no misleading links or adverts that are disguised as UI buttons. The website's content and is also design are generally respectful and inclusive.
Now to get into the use of “Dark Patterns”. Dark patterns refer to user interface design elements that manipulate or deceive users into taking certain actions, often benefiting the organization. These designs exploit psychological vulnerabilities, influencing user behaviour in non-transparent ways. Examples include misleading language, hidden information, and pre-ticked boxes. Dark patterns can damage user trust and lead to frustration. In the context of the Two Oceans Aquarium website, the absence of dark patterns contributes to its ethical design and user-friendly experience, the website does not appear to use deceptive buttons, auto opt-ins, or guilt tactics to manipulate user behaviour. Users are able to opt out any time, cancel subscriptions and decline cookies without difficulty. There is not any persuasion involved.
To conclude this analysis, The Two Oceans Aquarium website effectively showcases the aquarium's mission and activities while providing a user-friendly experience. The website's strengths include its consistency, its captivating visual design, intuitive navigation, and also the clear CTAs. However, there are areas for improvement, such as enhancing content layout and weight. The website respects all of the design and technical elements relevant to UI and UX design and for that reason I would say it is a good website that provides a satisfactory and straightforward user experience. As Vaidya (2020) suggests, accessibility guidelines for information architecture, UX design, and visual design are crucial for ensuring an inclusive user experience, and the Two Oceans Aquarium website has provided just that.
